= Spring Cloud Data Flow VSCode Extension Documentation

_Spring Cloud Data Flow VSCode Extension_ main focus is to ease managing _SCDF_
environments from a developer perspective and to provide easier way to debug
_streams_ and _tasks_ at a runtime environments.

**NOTE:** As we're still in an initial development stage, this extension is not
yet available from a VSCode marketplace. Extension can be installed using a latest
_vsix_ file available from a https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot-local/org/springframework/cloud/dataflow/vscode-spring-cloud-dataflow/[SCDF VSCode Extension Snapshot Repo].
These files has a format _vscode-spring-cloud-dataflow-<version>-next.<date>.<time>.<gitref>.vsix_
where latest build is at a bottom of a page.

== Extension Basics

After extension is activated there is a new view on a activation bar with a _SCDF logo_
which gives a view into your configured _SCDF_ environments. In this view we're basically
following what's available in _SCDF UI_ giving separate sections for *apps*, *streams*,
*tasks* and *jobs*.

**NOTE:** Credentials are stored in an OS keyring meaning you don't see those leaking
into VSCode's configuration files.

== Manage Applications

_Apps_ section has a navigator which allows you to browse registered apps, sources, processors,
sinks and tasks. Navigator also shows application versions and allows you to _unregister_ or set
_default version_ directly from a tree.
