[[vscode-install-extension]]
== Installing Extension

Extension can be installed using a latest _vsix_ file available from a
https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot-local/org/springframework/cloud/dataflow/vscode-spring-cloud-dataflow/[SCDF VSCode Extension Snapshot Repo].
These files has a format _vscode-spring-cloud-dataflow-<version>-next.<date>.<time>.<gitref>.vsix_
where latest build is at a bottom of a page.

While it's easy to install _vsix_ within a *VSCode* itself, for those wanting to
handle new install and updated install from a command line, generic flow is like:

[source, bash]
----
$ code --uninstall-extension vscode-spring-cloud-dataflow-0.0.1-next.20191102.163127.8ba2b02.vsix
$ code
$ code --install-extension vscode-spring-cloud-dataflow-0.0.1-next.20191102.163127.8ba2b02.vsix
----

[TIP]
====
It's a little unknown annoyance in VSCode that when updating your extension
from a command line like this, after you've done the _uninstall-extension_
you need to once start VSCode for uninstallation to actually happen, then
you just do _install-extension_ and you're ready to go.
