== Extension Basics

After extension is activated there is a new view on a activation bar with a _SCDF logo_
which gives a view into your configured _SCDF_ environments. In this view we're basically
following what's available in _SCDF UI_ giving separate sections for *apps*, *streams*,
*tasks* and *jobs*.
