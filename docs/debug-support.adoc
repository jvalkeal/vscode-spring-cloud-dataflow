== Debug Support

We're still trying to figure out what is a best approach for this extension
to support debugging streams and tasks in a running SCDF environment. Essentially
this boils down to be able to connect you debugger into a running stream or
task application.

We currently have a support for this to work on a limited capability when
working with a local environment.

=== Debugging Streams

Generic stream debug workflow is shown below:

What happened in this debug session:

- Simple _ticktock_ stream is created.
- We have a sources for _log sink_ in a workspace.
- Extension is able to detect running debug settings from a stream app instance.
- Debug session is launched.
- We go to source where actual log entry happens and put a breakpoint there.
- Session is halted.

[[vscode-debug-support-tasks]]
=== Debugging Tasks

Generic task debug workflow is shown below:

What happened in this debug session:

- Simple _timestamp_ task is created.
- We have a sources for _timestamp task_ in a workspace.
- We go to source where actual log entry happens and put a breakpoint there.
- Task is launced with instruction to suspend a session.
- Extension is able to detect running debug settings from a task app instance.
- Debug session is launched.
- Session is halted.
