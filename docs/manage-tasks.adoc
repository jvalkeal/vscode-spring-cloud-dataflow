=== Task Language

_SCDF Task Language_ is a *scdfs* format for defining task definition and their
launch configurations.

_Task Definition_ can have associated metadata sections which either adds instructions
to main definition or its launch configuration. For example it's possible to define
_@name_ to define a stream name or _@desc_ to define a stream description.

For deploy sections it's also possible to define generic deployment properties using
_@prop_ tag and a _@arg_ tag to define tasks command line arguments.
