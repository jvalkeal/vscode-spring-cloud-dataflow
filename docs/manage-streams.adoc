== Manage Streams

_Streams_ section has a navigator which allows you to browse existing streams.

=== Stream Language

_SCDF Stream Language_ is a *scdfs* format for defining stream definitions and their
deploy configurations.

_Stream Definition_ can have associated metadata sections which either adds instructions
to main definition or its deployer configuration. For example it's possible to define
_@env_ to associate it to particular environment, _@name_ to define a stream name,
_@desc_ to define a stream description.

For deploy sections it's also possible to define generic deployment properties using
_@prop_ tag.
